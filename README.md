# Z-Search

I made this browser extension because I was tired of jumping tabs to find books on ZLibrary and Anna’s Archive after browsing on Amazon. Now, with this extension, you get two simple buttons right on the page—one for ZLibrary and one for Anna’s Archive. It’s made my life so much easier, and I hope it helps you too.

## Features

- **Regional ZLibrary Domains**: The extension dynamically selects the correct ZLibrary domain based on the region (e.g., `z-lib.gs`, `z-library.sk`, `1lib.sk`).
- **Direct Links to ZLibrary & Anna's Archive**: Provides easy one-click access to search the book on ZLibrary and Anna's Archive.
